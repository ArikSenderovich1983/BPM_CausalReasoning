Causal Identification in Business Process Management (BPM)

This repository helps identifying a causal query (P(D|do(V1 = 1) for instance) based on event logs of a business process. The algorithm is based on ID (Shpitser and Pear), and the observablility of variables in the input data. 
In addition to simple identification problem, it provides all possible sets of unobserved variables that can turn a non-identifiable query into identifiable.
